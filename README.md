# sans-ip-block-waf
An Example AWS CloudFormation template that creates an AWS WAF ACL which blocks traffic from IPs contained within the 
Recommended Block List published by DShield.org via The SANS Technology Institute.

## What is created?
The main objects created by this template are:
- AWS WAF ACL, Rule and Conditions (IPSet)
- Lambda function 

## What does it do?
This template helps setup a WAF ACL to block IPs listed on the Bad IP list.  It also sets up a Lambda function 
to help keep the WAF up-to-date with the current SANS list.   

## How to use
Create a stack using the template.  Everything, including the Lambda function is included.   

After creating a stack you can manually initiate an update by performing a test run on the Lambda function.  Hoever the updates are scheduled for
once an hour.

You will need an AWS CloudFront distribution 'in front' of your website that you can configure to work with an WAF ACL.
